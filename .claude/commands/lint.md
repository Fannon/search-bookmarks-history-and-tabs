description: Run ESLint validation
---

Run ESLint to check code style and catch common errors.

This executes `npm run lint` which validates all JavaScript files against the project's Biome configuration.

After linting:
- Report any errors or warnings
- Show file paths and line numbers for issues
- Suggest fixes for common patterns
- Confirm when linting passes with no issues

Always run lint before running tests or building.
